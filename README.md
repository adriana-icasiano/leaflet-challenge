# Leaflet Homework: Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

Using data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), visualize earthquake location, magnitude and depth, as well as the tectonic plates.

- Retrieve geojson data using d3.json
- Uisng L.tileLayer, create base street and topographical maps using Leaflet that plots the earthquakes based on latitude and longitude
- Uisng L.circle, created data markers that the location (lat and lng) of earthquakes, as well as reflect the magnitude (radius) of the earthquake by their size and and depth (color) of the earthquake by color (larger and darker circle represent larger magnitude and deeper earthquakes, respectively).
- Using bindPopup, created popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
- Using L.DomUtil.create, created a legend that will provide context for your map data.
- Visualize tectonic plates using L.polyline in Leaflet
- Add a satellite, outdoors and grayscale base maps as overlays to the base map from Map Box.
- Add layer controls to our map using L.control.
