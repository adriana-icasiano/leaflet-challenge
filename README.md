# Leaflet Homework: Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

Using data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), visualize earthquake location, magnitude and depth, as well as the tectonic plates.

- Create a map using Leaflet that plots the earthquakes based on latitude and longitude
- Create data markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color (larger and darker circle represent larger magnitude and deeper earthquakes, respectively).
- Create popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
- Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
- Visualize tectonic plates using L.polyline in Leaflet
- Add a satellite, outdoors and grayscale base maps as overlays to the base map.
- Add layer controls to our map.
